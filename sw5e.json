Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on.

One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.",

To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even.

The shelter is 8 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, and can house up to six Medium creatures. The shelter includes spikes that automatically mount to the ground, provided they can find purchase. The shelter comes with an integrated power generator, faint glowing lights in the interior which provide dim light, and creatures in the shelter are protected from the elements, including hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The shelter’s power generator lasts for seven days, after which it stops providing light. The shelter can be collapsed and restored over the course of 10 minutes."

Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith’s internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.",

Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun’s, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average."

The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans."

Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean’s daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one’s thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat."
